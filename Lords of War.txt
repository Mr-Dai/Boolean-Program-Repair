Lords of War, Act I
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maraad: King Varian, the hour grows late, you must sign the declaration of war.

Varian: I was just a child when my father rushed to confront the same evil.
        He didn't understand this.. warlords at all. That mistake cost him his life, and brought this kingdom to ruin.

Maraad: You are not your father.

Varian: I know. But how can I succeed where he failed.

Maraad: You can start by trusting my counsel. I have faced them before.

Varian: On Draenor, you were there. All those years ago. 

Maraad: Yes. Believe me, they are not invincible.

Varian: Then tell me of them, Maraad, tell me everything.

Maraad: Very well.

Kargath, had no clan.
He was raised to slay.
The ogre's cruelity was intolerable.
So he sought a way out.
The arena!
One hundred orc lives was the price for freedom.
Fight!
Kill!
Salute!
Kargath was unstoppable, and the day of his final fight has come.
One last kill, and it was over.
One hundred lives.
Kargath had earned his reward, like every champion before him, buried beneath the arena.
The promise of freedom, nothing but a lie.
But Kargath would be chained no longer.

"Take your vengence!"

Bound by vengence, their name would be spoken in fear.
This was the birth of the shatterhand.

I understand your hesitation, my king. This mission will take great resolve.
There will be lives lost.

There are always lives lost, but marching our forces blindly into Draenor..

Poses unthinkable danger, yes! But you must have the fortitude to face whatever awaits us on the other side.
I assure you, our enemy's will is unweavering.

Let me tell you of their leader, a warlord who's defier in the face of death, became legend.
